# Software Developer Portal

## Overview

The Software Developer Portal uses Backstage, it is an open source framework for building developer portals. Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your microservices and infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.

Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.

## Backstage includes

Backstage Software Catalog for managing all your software: 

 - microservices 
 - libraries  
 - data pipelines 
 - websites 
 - ML models, etc.

Backstage Software Templates for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization’s best practices

Backstage TechDocs for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach

Plus, a growing ecosystem of open source plugins that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality

## Benefits

For engineering managers, it allows you to maintain standards and best practices across the organization, and can help you manage your whole tech ecosystem, from migrations to test certification.

For end users (developers), it makes it fast and simple to build software components in a standardized way, and it provides a central place to manage all projects and documentation.

For platform engineers, it enables extensibility and scalability by letting you easily integrate new tools and services (via plugins), as well as extending the functionality of existing ones.

For everyone, it’s a single, consistent experience that ties all your infrastructure tooling, resources, standards, owners, contributors, and administrators together in one place.
