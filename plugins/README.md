# The Plugins Folder

This is where your own plugins and their associated modules live, each in a
separate folder of its own.

If you want to create a new plugin here, go to your project root directory, run
the command `yarn new`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can also check out existing plugins on [the plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)!

# !! Amended plugins !! 

As part of the PoC, I've copied the source of certain plugins into this folder. This lets me amend and fix them without losing the changes when an install command is run.
